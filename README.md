# Ubuntu Auto Upgrade

This script will auto-upgrade ubuntu and send email notifications using SMTP. 
It will probably also work with other Debian variants of linux.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS

If you prefer python then there is also a python version of these scripts:
[ubuntu-auto-upgrade-py](https://github.com/diversen/ubuntu-auto-upgrade-py.git)

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/diversen/ubuntu-auto-upgrade.git
    cd ubuntu-auto-upgrade
    composer install

## Config

Create config files:

    cp -R config/* config-locale/

Edit SMTP settings in `config-locale/SMTP.php`. 
`DefaultTo` setting in SMTP is the email address of the person who will receive emails. 

You can also edit `config-locale/App.php`. `restart` determines if the server should restart if needed. 
You may also set `timezone`. 

## Cron

Set the script up as a cron script. Let it run every 10 minutes of so.
You will need to let the script run as root. Edit crontab as `sudo`, e.g.: 

    sudo crontab -e

Add the crontab line (change to your own source path):

    */10 * * * * cd /home/dennis/ubuntu-auto-upgrade && php cron.php

## Logs

Logs are written to `logs/main.log`. This log file will be created if it does not exist.
